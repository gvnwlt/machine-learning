# k-nearest neighbors (KNN)

KNN does groupings of a dataset and then predicts what group a new data point belongs to afterwards. 

Uses something like a step-by-step rule to guide it in making its decision on groupings.

# steps to performing KNN

  1) You have to choose the number of K of neighbors (how many groupings basically; common default is 5)

  2) Take the KNN of the new point, according to Euclidean distance

  3) Among these K neighbors, count the number of data points in each category. 

  4) Assign the new data point to the category were you counted the most neighbors.

  5) Done. 

  *Euclidean distance 
  D(p1, p2) = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2))

# K-NN is a non-linear classifier
