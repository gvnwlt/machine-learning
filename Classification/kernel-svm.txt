# Kernel Support Vector Machine

Good for situations where one cannot simply draw a line through a set of differentiating points because they do not follow a linear 
or even a logistic pattern for separation. 

Use for non-linearly separable data. 

Helps to choose the optimal decision boundary. 

In order to provide a solution for a non-linear problem, the data set must be mapped to a higher dimensional space.

The use of a hyperplane (replaces using a line) may be needed to separate some data sets. 

Mapping to a higher dimensional space can be more computationally expensive. 

# steps to implementing a kernel svm 
  1) create a mapping function starting with a function that desribes the current dataset dimension 
  2) modify the function by upgrading it to a higher degree or order to generate a transform of the current points 
  3) draw a line within the newly higher dimensional plot to classfify the datapoints.
