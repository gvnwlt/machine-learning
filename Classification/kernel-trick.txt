# kernel trick 

# Gaussian RBF (radial based function) Kernel 

k(x, l^i) = e ^-x - l^i^2/ 2 sigma^2

*landmark l represents the center of the cone

*kernel function with x input vector and landamark input vector 

Quick way to visualize this is to think of a cone with the tip-top representing a value of 1 in 3-dimensional space. As a value for a particular input gets smaller
it rises up from the base of the cone toward one which effectively represents traversing a boundary inside of a circle if looking from the top. Any values that are
large will be outside of the base of the cone and are therefore classified as the other thing. 

Sigma increases the circumference of the cone's base. 

Creates a decision boundary without actually having to go into a higher dimensional space.
