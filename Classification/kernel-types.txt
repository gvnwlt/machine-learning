# kernel types 

# linear kernel

# polynomial kernel
  -uses a polynomial type line to create a decision boundary using higher order terms

# Gaussian RBF kernel (rbf - Radial Basis Function)
  -typical bell curve distribution
  -separates classes without having to resort to moving up to a higher dimensional space 
  -used for classifations that require more of a circular decision boundary 

# sigmoid kernel
  -uses sigmoid to determine a classification depending on where an input falls on the s curve.
  -K(X,y) = tahh(y * Xtransform*Y + r)
