# logistic regression 

# classifying basics 
  Generally follows a sigmoid function to select a classification based on inputs. 

  Logistic regression is considered a linear classifier. 

  Determines probability of classification based on input. 

  (sigmoid function)
  p =    1        
      --------
      1 + e^-y
   

        p
  ln(--------) = b0 + b1*x
      1  - p

# finding probabilities 
  Project input values onto sigmoid model to discover the probability for a classification. 

# predicted values
  Get by placing a set point to predict a value as yay or nay based on the probability level.
