# support vector machines (SVM)

Developed in the 1960's and were refined in the 1990's and are again becoming very popular in machine learning because they are different than other
machine learning algorithms. 

Generates a line to separate data points. 

All about finding the best decision boundary (line) that separates the possible classifications.

Each point in SVM is considered a vector in this context. 

The line that separates classes is known as the maximum margin hyperplane (or classifier).

The margins for a line are classified as positive hyperplane and negative hyperplane.

Not strictly a linear classifier. Can use Gaussian, logistic, sigmoid, and other kernels to make classifications.


# Steps to implementing SVM
  1) Line is generated 
  2) Maximum margin is set on the line and it calculates the distance of the 'support vectors'. The line and margin find two points that represent a class.
