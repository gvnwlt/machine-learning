# building a model 

# backward elimination *fastest one of all
  1) select a significance level 
  2) fit the full model with all possible predictors 
  3) consider the predictor with the highest p-value. If p > sl, go to 4, else DONE
  4) remove the predictor 
  5) fit the model without this variable (rebuild the model)

# forward selection (a low p-value here means the variable is significant)
  1) select a significance level to enter the model 
  2) fit all simple regression models y ~ xn and select the one with the lowest p-value
  3) keep this variable and fit all possible models with one extra predictor added to ones already have 
  4) consider the predictor with the lowest p-value. If p < sl, go to step 3, else DONE 
  
# bidirectional elimination 
   1) select a significance level to enter and to stay in the model 
   2) perform the next step forward selection
   3) perform all steps of backward elmination (keep repeating back to 3 until condition 4 is reached)
   4) no new variables can enter and no old variables can exit
