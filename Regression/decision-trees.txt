# decision trees 

 This is basically another form of clustering data values to find unique grouping or 
 patterns in a given dataset (features of interest). Using this tool is good for narrowing
 in on what features really matter in a dataset, in particular, features that have a 
 strong correlation with a feature of interest (dependent variable) and that have enough
 variance to be interesting or worth while. 

 The logic to a decision tree is supplied by use of if-then-else to make decisions.

 Using the average of a dependent variable, a decision is made based on a set of 
 rules that dictate if it 'clamps' onto the average output y or not for a given
 input x.

 A decision tree can be a very powerful model in more dimensions (more than just one 
 or two).
