  Using the SSres and SStot the R^2 value can be founa with 
            SSres
  R^2 = 1 - ------
            SStot

  *SStot (sum of total errors) is the sum of yi minus the yavg squared 
  (SUM (yi - yavg)^2)

  The point of the regression line is to minimize the SSres.

  As SSres gets smaller the R2 value increases since there is less of an error occuring.

  R squared just represents how well the model is fitted to the data.


# linear regression (adjusted R squared) 
 
  aaj R^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2)n - 1
                         ------------
                         n - p - 1
  p = number of regressors (features or independent variables)
  n = sample size 

  Having more regressors penalizes the outcome for adjusted R-squared such that 
  has the number of p regressors increases in the denominator the error grows 
  larger.

  Adjusted R-squared is good for evaluating models that exceed 2 regressors. 
  
  
# Interpreting Linear Regression Coefficients 

  Use the dependent variable as the setter for indendendent variable unit values. 

  Know what your units are measured in in terms of independent and dependent variables. 

  The magnitude of the feature coefficient drives the independent variable in some way. 

  Think: for each increase/decrease in the independent variable x there is a increase/decrease in y.
