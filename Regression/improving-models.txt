# improving models 
  
# hyperparameters 
  -tuning knobs of a model in the form of a fixed regularization value lambda or penalty parameter
  -adjusting hyperparamters effects the performance of a model 
  -parameters that are learnt, such as coefficients in a linear regression, are another example of hyperparameters
  -finding the optimal value is exactly what parameter tuning is about
