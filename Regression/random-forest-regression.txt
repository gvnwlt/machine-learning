# random forest regression

INTRO
  A random forest is just a team of decision trees (more granualated form of a decision
  tree; higher resolution, thus more accurate, but at a cost).

HOW IT WORKS
  1) Pick random K data points from the Training set.
  2) Build the Decision Tree associated to these K data points. 
  3) Choose the number Ntree of trees you want to build and repeat STEPS 1 & 2
  4) For a new data point, make each one of your Ntree trees predict the value of Y to
  for the data point in question, and assign the new data point the average across all
  of the predicted Y values.
