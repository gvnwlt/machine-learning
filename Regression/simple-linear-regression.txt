# simple linear regression

# regression: a return to a former or less developed state

# regression line: line that represents a going back from truth data which is, oc can be, messy to a regression line that 
resembles some order out of the data; if the regression line is to far from the truth data it is useless 

# mainly uses 'sum of squared errors' or 'sum of squares of residuals' to determine what 
the best slope for prediction is (SUM(yi - yihat)^2 -> min)

# the line with the smallest sum will be the simple linear regression model

# gives you equation to predict values for the output variable by plugging in values for the input variables

# describes relationship between one or more input variables and an output variable 

# in a nutshell the regression process is about running a number of different regression lines and choosing the one with the 
  best orinary least squares value (sum score with least errors)

# assumptions of a linear regression
  1) linearity
  2) homoscedasticity (variance around the regression line is about the same)
  3) multivariate normally
  4) independence of errors 
  5) lack of multicollinearity (one predictor variable can be predicted from others)

# p-values 
  -use the pvalue to determine the likeliness that the null-hypothesis is to be rejected (the higher the value we are a saying 
  there is less evidence to reject the null hypothesis) 
  -high pvalue says that it would be pretty normal to get this particular sample if the null hypothesis were true 
  -p value is a tool used by scientists to determine wheter or not their hypothesis is correct 
  -the p value offers insight as to whether the sample data is common or not 
  -scientists generally set the p value threshold to something like 0.05 which if the p value follows below this level then their
  hypothesis gets rejected
  -p values are usually found on a reference table by first calculating a chi square value

  # degrees of freedom
    -number of 'n' categories to observe or examine (n - 1)
    -this value is used in conjunction of the results of the 'observered value' and the 'expected value' to produce the chi square
    value (so this somewhat gives a fuzzy idea of how likely the same kind if sample is likely to occur based on plugging in the 
    chi score to the reference table that corresponds to a p value)
    -also using the signficance level in conjuction with chi sqaures produces the p value 
    -a typical sig level is 5% or p<0.05 which means that there is at most a 5% chance of the sample being reproduced randomly
    -use the chi squares value and dof to determine the p-value on reference table (once value exceeds the chi value the corresponding
    value for the column should be selected for the p-value)
