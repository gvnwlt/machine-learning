# kernels 
  Real life problems are generally randomly distributed. 

  A kernel (kernel trick) is a method of using linear classifiers to solve a non-linear problem. 

  In a nutshell a kernel is just another function used in some way to make sense of a real world problem by means of higher 
  dimensionality if necessary. 

  In Kaggle, 'kernel' is used to replace the term 'script', since a kernel can be applied differently. 

# hyperplanes 
  A subspace of one dimension less than its ambient space. 

  A line in a svm for example, that separates two classifications is representative of a hyperplane.
